The upper limit thing is also done above in the 'allowing skidding' section.","isHighlighted":false,"canVote":false,"thread":"547949719","forum":"iforce2d","depth":1,"points":0,"isEdited":false},{"dislikes":0,"numReports":0,"likes":0,"message":"\u003cp>Thanks for the quick response.

<p>Thanks for this tutorial. Is really usefull. This qb2 top down car 
implementation is really good, but i think Your implementation is quite 
similar.</p><p>Florian Knoll made your vehicle implementation for 
AndEngine, not for libgdx. Besides is not one-to-one conversion - some 
stuff is missing.</p><p>Implementation for libgdx can be downloaded from here <a href="http://1drv.ms/1r7wXIE" rel="nofollow">http://1drv.ms/1r7wXIE</a> .</p><p>I made it today and it's exactly what you have done in your code - with no changes at all.</p><p>I just felt that I should do something instead of copying and pasting your code to my project.</p><p>Thanks again for good car physics.</p><p>Regards,<br>Lukasz</p>

<p>Hey, I'm trying to implement this in java and I found some weird 
behavior in updateDrive function: m_body-&gt;ApplyForce( force * 
currentForwardNormal, m_body-&gt;GetWorldCenter() );<br>When I stop 
pressing anything, the speed will go down and the force ends up 
switching every frame between +maxDriveForce and -maxDriveForce. That 
wouldn't bother me that much, but when maxDriveForce is sth like 20 and 
my speed is in one frame almost 0 (e.g. -1), it will keep switching 
between +19 and -1, (where 19 is the speed we got by applying 20 newtons
 to our speed) which results in an average speed of 10 and therefore the
 car never stops moving. Is there some elegant way to kill the speed 
with just force application, or do I need to apply impulses to actually 
stop the car?</p><p>I think you didn't need to solve this because of the
 updateFriction function kinda solves it (with killing forward speed) 
and thanks to good constants settings, but I kinda messed my constants 
up, so I want to solve this in a better way.</p>

<p>I see. It only works in my case because it alternates between 
applying an equal force in opposite directions which averages to 
nothing... <br>Perhaps you could scale down the magnitude of the force 
applied as the current velocity and the desired velocity become closer. 
Or, don't apply any force when the desired and current velocities are 
close enough (some arbitrary threshold).</p>

<p>I found nicer solution - when there is no key pressed (and therefore 
desiredSpeed = 0), I return and do nothing, and let the friction does 
the work. I think it's much clearer when there is only one function that
 decreases the speed and also it's even more evident. updateDrive should
 do just input handling and updateFriction do friction.</p><p>That leads me to question, why you didn't do it this way?</p>

<p>Hi ! This tutorial has been very useful to me, thank you so much !</p><p>I
 actually implemented your code in a supersprint like game I've started 
using box2dweb. Now I'm wondering how I could make some AI cars take 
part in the race with me. I got inspired by the system Doug Koellmer 
uses in his implementation (this seems to be some distance joints towing
 the cars along), but his AI cars seem to be towed only along vertical 
and horizontal lines. <br>What if I want my AI cars to be towed along a 
loop edge chain corresponding to the perfect track trajectory ? In other
 words, how can one distance joint anchor be moved along the edges of a 
loop chain ?<br>Would there be a better AI engine anyway ?<br>Sorry if this question has already been asked ! ;-)</p>

<p>Sounds like a pretty complex thing, to do properly. For example, you 
would probably also want the cars to avoid each other a little, instead 
of all just globbing together along the line. Maybe you could try some 
kind of 'boid' approach: <a href="http://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/" rel="nofollow">http://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids...</a><br>As
 for the actual steering, it's hard to say without trying but I think 
towing them along might look a bit odd. Ideally they would be controlled
 by forces and the angle of their wheels.</p>

<p>How are you able to do this:<br>b2Vec2 impulse = m_body-&gt;GetMass() * -getLateralVelocity(); //existing code<br>impulse
 is b2Vec2 which is a class with two components, m_body-&gt;GetMass() 
returns a float, then you are *- or *= if it's a typo with 
getLaterVelocity() which returns a b2Vec2?  So you are trying to convert
 between the b2Vec2 class and a float, this should not be possible?!  
I've looked at the Box2D lib and this should not compile!</p>

<p>You mean to completely lock the rear wheels? That would be like 
killing the lateral velocity as shown above, but you would not restrict 
it to the lateral direction. So, just apply an impulse in the opposite 
direction to current movement.</p><p>Of course, you would need to have 
an upper limit on how much impulse can be applied, otherwise the car 
would just stop immediately. The upper limit thing is also done above in
 the 'allowing skidding' section.</p>

<p>Thanks for the quick response. Basically, that is the way I 
implemented it but there was one difference. I applied force, not an 
impulse, to a body.  Now the car behaves more realistic when 
'hand-braking', so thanks a lot.</p>

<p>So i think you mainly show how to do this physics using box2d. I 
would like more teoretical explanation because i dont know it. I just 
cant get whats going on in code. But maybe i should find the other more

<p>The b2Dot function returns the 'dot product' of two vectors. Dot 
product is a very common thing when dealing with vectors and you can 
find information about it all over the internet. It's usually used to 
find out how similar the direction of the two vectors is.</p><p>As a brief summary:<br>Suppose
 you have two vectors, each of length 1. Their dot product will be 1 if 
they are pointing in exactly the same direction, and -1 if they are 
pointing in exactly opposite directions. If they are perpendicular to 
each other, the dot product will be zero. For angles in between, the dot
 product will be the cosine of the angle between them (and negative if 
they are pointing away from each other).</p>

<p>Good question. The easiest way might be to use friction joints 
between the ground and each tire. Friction joints attempt to prevent 
movement between the two bodies they join, and you can set a maximum 
force for them. You could reduce the force when a tire is over a 
slippery area.</p><p>The collision barrier circles in the YouTube video are using friction joints.</p>

<p>i see, i never though that, thanks :)<br>two more question : <br>1. is the position of ground body and tire position have any effect to the friction joint ?<br>2.
 i found this on internet, jdef.maxForce = wheel.mas * 9.8; 
jdef.maxTorque = wheel.mass * width * height * 9.8; where 9.8 is the 
gravity, do you think that's correct ?</p><p>EDIT:<br>- i have try to 
create one ground body on center of the world, and the joint def is 
jdef.localAnchorB = Tire-&gt;getPosition(); but seems the friction 
doesn't work at all, my vehicle on the (270,270) btw.<br>- my other option is to create that body each time before braking and delete it after.</p><p>EDIT:<br>- the culprit is jdef.maxforce and jdef.maxtorque, can you give me suggestion ?</p>

<p>For the joint anchor in a static body, the anchor position will have 
no effect, but for a static body it will. Try the javascript demo here:<br><a href="https://www.iforce2d.net/rube/loaders/javascript/" rel="nofollow">https://www.iforce2d.net/rube/...</a></p><p>... and choose the "Joint Types" test.</p><p>The
 B body in the middle (the one that the small box falls onto at the 
start) is joined to a static body by a friction joint. You can turn on 
joint display with the checkbox at the bottom of the page to see that 
the joint anchor is toward one side of the B body. Push it around with 
the mouse a bit, and you will see how the position of the anchor causes 
friction to be applied at the bottom of the B.</p><p>I think 
jdef.localAnchorB.Set( 0, 0 ); is better, because it will put the 
friction point at the tire position. Joint anchors are specified in 
local body coordinates, but Tire-&gt;GetPosition() will give you world 
coordinates.</p><p>I don't really know about the formula... it looks OK I guess.</p>

<p>Thanks for this great tutorial! I've implemented a customized version
 of this in a game I'm writing, but for some reason no matter what I 
tweak, the current speed always seems to be capped at 40.0. I don't 
suppose you know why that might be?</p>

what the fps is? What unexpected results are you seeing? You can alter

<p>I am like half-way through reading this and I have to say, big 
thanks, this has been a great help. Before I forget, I'd like to clear 
out a few things:<br>1. "If you push the tire in the forward direction 
you will find that it tends to go around in a circle" - I did not 
experience this :(, the tyre went straight forward.<br>2. When you apply
 drag to forward velocity, what kind of drag do you mean? If it's the 
aerodynamic drag, should it not be applied to the car? Instead, I think a
 rolling friction should be applied, which should work similarly to the 
lateral friction, only with a lesser force.<br>3. The skidding formula 
could be simplified, now it is impulse = impulse / len(impulse) * 
max_impulse, which in fact is impulse = currentRightnormal * max_impulse<br>4.
 Regarding the skidding, your equation assumes that static friction = 
dynamic friction. Instead, it would be nice to have a hasGrip boolean, 
and if the reaction force is higher that the max_impulse, dynamic 
friction comes into place.</p><p>Note: maybe you added this later on, I just felt like I had to post this :P</p>

<p>Hello. Great example. I have a question. How would you implement a 
handbrake? That stops the car but with the necessary speed, it locks the
 car's rear wheels and the car skids. I've been touching and tweaking my
 Java port of your code, but I can't figure out a way to do this.<br>Thanks a lot, great job.</p>

<p>oh... you might want to clamp the drag force to a maximum value 
though, in the same way that the lateral-velocity-killing impulse is 
clamped - otherwise when you handbrake at high speed the handbrake will 
seem super powerful :)</p>

<p>Hmm... what if you just stopped all the other controlling you are 
doing (killing lateral velocity, driving force, drift etc) and replaced 
them with a simple drag force. Drag is just a force in the opposite 
direction to, and scaled by the magnitude of the current velocity, eg.</p><p>dragForce = -0.5f * body-&gt;GetLinearVelocity()</p><p>You
 could tweak the magnitude to something that feels right, and you would 
probably also want to scale it down for lower friction surface types.</p>

<p>Hey, great. With your advice I've come to something similar than what I accomplished before (but a really bit better).<br>This is my code:</p><p>if
 (isRear &amp;&amp; handbreak) {			dragForceMagnitude = -16 * 
currentForwardSpeed;		} else {			dragForceMagnitude = 
Params.TIRE_DRAG_FORCE_MAG_SCALAR					* currentForwardSpeed; /* default 
mag = -2 */                }<br>}<br>I've cancelled the cancellation (:P) of the horizontal and angular speed with a similar conditional.<br>The car goes a lot slower and the rear tires skid, mission complete!<br>But:
 When I press the handbrake key, the rear wheels seems to be sliding on 
ice xD I suppose that with a little more of tweaking I'll succeed on 
making a realistic drift.<br>(I'm making a rally game n_n)<br>Thanks a lot! And cheers from Argentina!</p>
